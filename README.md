# EldenRingBackup
This is a super simple backup tool that can create a copy of your EldenRing folder every hour... That's all it does. It is read only as far as anyone is concerned and cannot result in a softban. Simply edit the settings file to guide the program to your origin and destination folders, then run the executable to continually backup while you play. You should create a new folder specifically to host the backups, you can do this wherever you want. You might want to clear old backups every few days, but the space they take up is really inconsequentailly small. This can be ran and closed before/after a play session to create an automatic backup, or you can run it continually in the background while you play, even while playing online. It's that easy.
